Idea:
See Ballance from AtariGames :)
-The player controlls a sphere, which can change its material.
-The level track is divided in parts, which are made of different materials.

Prototyping:
-Behaviour of different materials.

Materials - Sphere:
- Paper: light, destroyed by fire/water/everything, small momentum, 
- Stone: heavy, sphere gets smaller when heavy collided, big momentum, cant roll on:  water,  
- Wood: medium, default material, floats on water, destroyed by fire, moving objects, cant roll on:  
- Rubber: medium-light, bounces, floats on water, destroyed by fire, cant roll just jump, can the sphere jump by itself?, begin on high terrain
- Magnet: very heavy, magnetic, cant roll on:  water, 
- Soap bubble: very light, floats in the air, destroyed on collision
- Ice: destroyed when collided, floats on water,  good friction on: wood, 


Materials - Ground:
- Wood: medium friction, default
- Metal(Iron, Nickel, Cobalt): good friction for rubber and magnet sphere, bad friction for the rest
- Ice: very low friction, (what about rubber?)
- Stone: good friction, higher jumps of rubber than on wood
- Water: 

Behaviour/Features:
- Change material sphere with "transformators"
- Fans
- Flying objects
- Static objects
- Elevators
- Robotic arms
- Fire objects
- Water pits
- Freeze water to ice
-  

Prios:
- Wood
- Stone
- Ice
- Paper
- Rubber
- Magnetic
- Soap bubbles


Balancing:
- mass
- torque
- friction
- jump hight
- magnetic force( distance to source)
- restitution
- damping
- camera distance borders
-

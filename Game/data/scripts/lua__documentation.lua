### File structure

Your script will be executed only once. This means your
initialization code can be placed right in the executed script.
For example you can create some GameObjects,
register your update functions for them and they are
afterwards used by the game engine to simulate your world.


### GameObjects

GameObjects can be created via the global GameObjectManager.
Already existing GameObjects can be retrieved by name.

	local go = GameObjectManager:createGameObject("GameObjectName")
	local go = GameObjectManager:getGameObject("GameObjectName")

Afterwards, you can use available member functions on objects,
attach components etc.
Additionally, you can set and get an object's position with the member
functions

	go:setPosition(Vec3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0))
	local position = go:getPosition()

It's very important to finish the initialization of each GameObject
you create with the following call, because otherwise the game
engine won't load them correctly.

	go:initialize()

	
### Components

Components can be created and attached to GameObjects directly
with a given GameObject. The usage schema looks like

	local xxxComponent = go:createXxxComponent()
	local xxxComponent = go:getXxxComponent()

	
## ScriptComponent

The script component is needed to be able to register update functions
for your objects. This is done in the following manner:
	
	local scriptComponent = go:createScriptComponent()
	
	scriptComponent:setUpdateFunction("go_update")
or
	go:getScriptComponent():setUpdateFunction("go_update")
	
Where "go_update" is the name of an existing lua_function that takes
two parameters: The corresponding GameObject and the elapsed time
in milliseconds:

	function go_update(gameObjectName, elapsedMilliseconds) end


## PhysicsComponent

PhysicsComponents own a RigidBody, that you can create
with a given PhysicsComponent. However, a RigidBody needs a set
of Infos that describe its physical behaviour. This is done via
a CInfo object. The important CInfo attributes are listed below.

	local physicsComponent = go:createPhysicsComponent()
	local cinfo = RigidBodyCInfo()
	cinfo.shape = PhysicsFactory:createBox(1,1,1)
	cinfo.mass = 10
	cinfo.motionType = MotionType.Dynamic
	cinfo.restitution = 1
	cinfo.friction = 1
	cinfo.angularDamping = 1
	cinfo.linearVelocity = Vec3(1, 1, 1)
	cinfo.angularVelocity = Vec3(1, 0, 1)
	physicsComponent:createRigidBody(cinfo)


The MotionType is a global enum datastructure:

	1 = Dynamic
	5 = Fixed

RigidBodies are static by default. So you will mostly 

The only available Shapes for this lesson are boxes and spheres. You
can create them via the PhysicsFactory global. The box factory method
takes the half sides of a box, the sphere only needs a radius.

	boxShape = PhysicsFactory:createBox(1,1,1)
	sphereShape = PhysicsFactory:createSphere(1)


### KEYS

The global InputHandler lets you query the keyboard state. You will
probably only need the first function of those:

	InputHandler:isPressed(0x53)
	InputHandler:wasTriggered(0x53)
	
The parameter the two functions take are keyCodes, that you can look
up here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85).aspx

Tip: You can define a few globals in your script for the keys you want
to use:

	VK_UP = 0x26

	
### RENDER OUTPUT

While your GameObjects will be drawn automatically, you can use the
global DebugRenderer to print Text on a certain screen position.

	DebugRenderer:printText(Vec2i(100,100),"Hello World ")
